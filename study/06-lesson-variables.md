# Lesson 2: Variables

Letâ€™s keep learning some R skills! These examples are a bit trickier than the ones you just saw.

Often, when people do coding, they need to store the results of a calculation so they can refer to it later. For example, you might want your computer to remember pi for you.

For example, try running the code below:

**DC**

Remember how we said = is used to create variables? That's what just happened: we made up a name for our variable and assigned a value to it.

Create a variable named fav_num and assign it to your favorite number.

**DC**

Awesome! But variables seem pretty boring by themselves. What's the point? One thing we could try is using our variables in a regular old calculation.

What happens when you type fav_num + 1?

**DC**


Interesting. What happens when you create fav_num again, with a different number than what you had before? My favorite number is 7.

Try creating fav_num with the number 7.

**DC**

When we're doing coding, we call this variable reassignment. Variables are like buckets: we can put stuff in them. When we reassigned the variable, we just took out the number that was already in the bucket and replaced it with something else. That's why it's called a variable: we are able to vary (change) it.


Great job! Let's move on to the next lesson.
