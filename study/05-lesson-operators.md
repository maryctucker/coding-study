# Lesson 1: Operators

Most programming languages can act like basic calculators.

Try calculating 627 / 3 in the window below.

Nice! R supports all the basic functions: * for multiplication, / for division, - for subtraction, and + for addition.

You can also combine multiple operations, using () to tell R which operations you want to do first.

Try running 100 * 2 + 5  and then 100 * (2 + 5) in the window below.

What happens if you try to type 8 + 8 = 16?

**DC**

You get an error. That's because when we do coding we use the  = operator to create variables, which we will talk about later. If we want to check whether two values are equal to each other, use ==.

Try checking whether 8 is equal to 8, and then check whether 8 + 8 is equal to 16.

Great work! You're doing some excellent R coding! Let's move on to the next lesson.
