Weâ€™re going to give you a chance to do some coding!

Coding (also called computer programming) involves all kinds of tasks, from running simulations to creating websites. People do coding in lots of different jobs and fields. In the field of data science, for example, people do coding to organize, visualize, and analyze data.

Just like human languages, there are many computer programming languages, and each one is used by different groups of people. Unlike human languages, however, programming languages are usually built to accomplish specific purposes. For example, JavaScript is often used for writing computer games, and Swift is used to make apps. Today we will introduce you to a programming language built for analyzing data, called R.

On the next few pages, you'll complete some tasks designed to help you do some coding in the R programming language.
Please try your best on each task, as this will result in deeper learning.
